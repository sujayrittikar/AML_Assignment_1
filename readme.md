# Advanced Machine Learning Assignment 1: MathE Dataset

1. Classification: Understanding the answer patterns
  - Classifying whether an answer is correct or not, based on features: Student Country, Question Level, Topic, Subtopic, and Keywords.
  - Refer to the notebook [classification.ipynb](https://github.com/sujayrittikar/AML_Assignment_1/blob/main/classification.ipynb)
2. Regression: Understanding Personalized Learning
  - Predicting the average score of correct answers, based on question-level characteristic features: Student Country, Question Level, Topics, Subtopics, and Keywords.
  - Refer to the notebook [regression.ipynb](https://github.com/sujayrittikar/AML_Assignment_1/blob/main/regression.ipynb)
3. Clustering: Understanding the topic trends
  - Identify the clusters of topics using the features: Question Level, Keywords, and Student Country.
  - Refer to the notebook [clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/sujayrittikar/AML_Assignment_1/blob/main/clustering.ipynb)
